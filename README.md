# Simulating radiative transfer using Monte Carlo methods

**Section I**: Random numbers drawn from a non-flat probability distribution, this is achieved once by using a rejection method and again by using an inverse cumulative distribution function. Two histograms are produced to verify that the methods are working accordingly.

**Section II**: Isotropic scattering. 10<sup>6</sup> photons are ejected from the origin at varying angles Ï‘, which scatter until they escape the medium. Scattering patterns are plotted. 

**Section III**: Rayleigh scattering. Optical depth is varied to show why the sky is blue.
